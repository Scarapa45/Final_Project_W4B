<p style=color:#F5F5F5;>Introduction:<br><br>
Gannett Peak is located within the Wind River Range of Wyoming and sits at 13,809â€™. This mountain is not the tallest mountain in the region, but it has its own set of challenges due to its distance from any roads. 
The issue when people attempt Gannett, is that if any avalanches happen, help will not come until it is too late. 
More and more people are climbing it and beginning to attempt it during periods of avalanche risk. Yet, there is little information out there on which slopes are the most avalanche prone on the most popular route. My project aims to add clarification to route risk and exposure to avalanches on Gannett Peak.

    <p style=color:#F5F5F5;>Planning:<br><br>
        The most popular route is the Titcomb Basin trail, starting 11 miles from Pinedale, WY, south of Gannett Peak. 
The second most popular route, Glacier Trail, starts near Dubois, Wyoming northwest of Gannett Peak. 
Unlike Colorado 14ers, and the mountains near Jackson Hole, there are no avalanche forecasts for the area around Gannett Peak. 
Since the closest maintained road during the summer is over 20 miles away, it is imperative that people have proper knowledge of the routes that are prone to avalanche danger. 
Gannett is a mountain that is not well documented like other peaks for routes and climbing, so it is imperative to shed some light on possible risks in attempting this mountain during winter or shoulder seasons.
